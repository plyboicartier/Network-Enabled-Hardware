            DCA is producing a <b>flowmeter</b> which will measure the volume and speed of water moving through a pipe<br>
            <img src="../images/BlockDiagram-1.png" alt="block diagram of flowmeter components" width="75%"><br>
            The above image displays the basic block diagram of the flowmeter components. <br>
            These components include the Wi-Fi chip, Ethernet chip (both to allow the end user to see their water usage in real time), <br>
            the microcontroller, and the ultrasonic sensors, which will non-invasively measure water volume. <br>
            <img src="../images/WINC-1.png" alt="pinout for wi-fi chip" width="75%"> <br>
            The above image displays the pinout of the WINC (Wi-Fi) chip which will be interfaced with the microcontroller <br>
            <img src="../images/Ethernet-1.png" alt="pinout for enthernet chip" width="75%"> <br>
            The above image displays the pinout of the ENC (Ethernet) chip which will be interfaced with the microcontroller <br>
            Both the ENC and the WINC chips will allow us to use real-time updates to deliver information regarding flow rate and <br>
            water usage as fast as possible when connected to the internet <br>
            <img src="../images/DCA_USMR_SENSOR-1.png" alt="pinout for sensor" width="75%"> <br>
            The above image displays the pinout and circuit of the sensor module. The sensor reads the movement speed of the water <br>
            based on the speed of sound travelling from one point to another. This is where the magic really happens, the information <br>
            is then sent to the micrcontroller to be compared against other points of data and flow rate is determined.
            <img src="../images/MC-1.png" alt="pinout for microcontroller" width="75%"> <br>
            The above image displays the pinout of the SAMD microcontroller. The microcontroller is the brains of the system and is <br>
            what allows all mathematical operations to be completed. The microcontroller receives data from the sensor(s) and sends it <br>
            to the internet to update the client as soon as possible.
