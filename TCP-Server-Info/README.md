# Assignment 5 <br>
## Goal <br>
 - Edit Microsoft provided code to create a TCP server using WinSock that receives data
## Description <br>
1. Create a TCP server to receive data. The server receives strings delimited by &. Your program should display each received string on a separate line on the console. For example, if the received string is abcdef&qwerty&123, the output is:
<br>
abcdef
<br>
qwerty
<br>
123
<br>
Your program prints each string as soon as it is complete (that is, an ‘&’ is found). Test your program by sending data using “Telnet.”<br>
## Result <br>
