# Assignment 2 <br>
## Goal <br>
 - Become familiar with PHP
 - Use PHP with XAMPP to make a local server that can host PHP files
 - Develop skills with user input using $_POST
## Description <br>
1. [4 points] Create a form that lets user input two matrices, A and B. Each matrix should have<br>
    &emsp;two rows and two columns. This form does not provide any client-side data validation. Process<br>
    &emsp;the data submitted by the form using PHP such that:<br>
a) Data is validated on the server-side to not allow any empty fields and to only allow a<br>
    &emsp;number in each input field;<br>
b) The two matrices as well as their product are displayed in three separate tables.<br>
2. [3 points] Create a form that lets user input two positive integers. Form data should be<br>
    &emsp;processed using PHP to:<br>
a) Validate input data on the server to allow only positive integers; <br>
b) Display all prime numbers between the two positive integers in a table that has a separate<br>
    &emsp; cell for each prime number.<br>
## Result <br>
7/7 - 100%
