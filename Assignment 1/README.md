    &emsp; index.html file in the root folder. Move other html files inside the “files” folder. Structure<br>
    &emsp; the content within each file using appropriate html elements such as \<html\>, \<head\>,<br>
    &emsp; \<body\>, \<section\>, \<header\>, and \<footer\>. Each file needs a unique title and a navigation<br>
