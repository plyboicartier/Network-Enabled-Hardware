# Assignment 3 <br>
## Goal <br>
 - Become familiar with CSS
 - Develop user input skills further with $_POST
## Description <br>
1. [5 points] Modify the feedback.html file, created in Assignment 1. <br>
&emsp;a. Add a form with appropriate labels and with following client-side validated inputs fields:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;i. Name: At least one letter is required and accepts upper and lower case letters.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;ii. Email: Required and accepts only Conestoga College email addresses.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iii. Postal Code: Required and accepts a valid postal code.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iv. Message: Optional and accepts no more than 200 characters.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;v. Send” button: Submits the form performing indicated HTML5 validations.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;vi. “Reset” button: Clears all input fields.<br>
&emsp;b. Before form data is submitted, the form has following behaviour.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;i. When the html file is accessed, first input field gets the focus.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;ii. When any input field is in focus, its background colour is changed to aqua. Once valid<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;data is entered in a field, its background colour is changed to lime.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iii. After the submit button is clicked, the form data is processed by a php file that displays<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the data (name and value pairs) in tabular form with a different colour for even<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;numbered rows.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iv. Use CSS to move navigation list (created in Assignment 1) to the left of the form. The<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;list should cover approximately 25% of page width. Do not use a table to perform this<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;formatting.<br>
2. [3 points] Create another file with a form with appropriate labels to collect name, email, postal<br>
&emsp;code, and a message. Perform the following validations using server-side code:<br>
&emsp;a. Name: At least one letter is required and accepts upper and lower case letters.<br>
&emsp;b. Email: Required and accepts only Conestoga College email addresses.<br>
&emsp;c. Postal Code: Required and accepts a valid postal code.<br>
&emsp;d. Message: Optional and accepts no more than 200 characters.<br> <br>
Using PHP, display appropriate error messages upon form submission for any failed validations.<br>
## Result <br>
4.38/5 - 87.5%<br>
Name field took numbers as well as letters.
